The goal of ZipcodeUS is to provide data and tools for those looking for plot their address data.\
Attached functions could be used to clean zip codes before joinining with Zip table to obtain longtitudes/latitudes.


## Example


```{r example}
library(uszipcodes)
y <- c("1234 100th Street, New York, NY, 10001", "5678 100th Street, New York, NY, 23")
get_zip(y)
contain_letter(get_zip(y))
```

```{r}
x <- c("1234", "Li123"," 1234", "  123")
clean_zip(x)
```

## Zip table

```{r}
head(zip_table)
```

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("li-wen-li/uszipcodes")
```
